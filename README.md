# csv2xlsx
A fork of cpan's Text::csv_xs  helpful little csv2xlsx example with a touch more documentation, by H. Merijn Brand (https://metacpan.org/release/Text-CSV_XS)

I've forked this entirely to just import multiple csv files into one xslx file as multiple sheets. Sheets are numbered sequentially, in the order given to the program. 

This is occasionally invaluable.
